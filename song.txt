Alas, my love you do me wrong
To cast me off discourteously
And I have loved you so long
Delighting in your company.

Chorus:
Greensleeves was all my joy
Greensleeves was my delight
Greensleeves was my heart of gold
And who but my Lady Greensleeves.

I have been ready at your hand
to grant whatever you would crave;
I have both wagered life and land
Your love and good will for to have.
